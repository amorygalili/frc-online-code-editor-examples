# Example Challenges

This is a challenge project generated by frc-challenge-cli.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Challenge Structure

- `src/main.tsx` - Entry point that mounts the editor and sets up the visualization
- `src/ChallengeVisualization.tsx` - Your custom challenge visualization component
- `dist/` - Built files (generated after running `npm run build`)

## Customization

Edit `src/ChallengeVisualization.tsx` to create your challenge-specific visualization. This component has access to:

- NetworkTables data through NT4 context
- HAL simulation data through HALSim context
- All the UI components and utilities from frc-challenge-site

## Building for Distribution

When you run `npm run build`, the challenge visualization will be built into the `dist/` folder. The built files will register your visualization with the frc-challenge-site package using `setSimVisualization()`.

When the challenge editor loads your challenge, it will:
1. Load your built JavaScript files from the dist folder
2. Call `getSimVisualization()` from the frc-challenge-site package to retrieve your registered visualization
3. Render your visualization in the simulation panel

Make sure to:
1. Commit the `dist/` folder to your git repository after building
2. Update your challenge's `metadata.json` file to point to the correct dist folder location using the `files.simVisualization` property
